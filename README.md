# Logistic-Regression-
This project implements a Logistic Regression model using Python to perform binary classification on a given dataset. Logistic Regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for predicting categorical outcomes based on independent variables. The project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a typical ML classification problem
